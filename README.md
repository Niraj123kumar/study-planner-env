# Study Planner OpenEnv

[![HF Space](https://img.shields.io/badge/🤗-Open%20in%20Spaces-blue)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/ride4code/study-planner-env) [![OpenEnv](https://img.shields.io/badge/OpenEnv-Compliant-green)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/ride4code/study-planner-env)

## Demo

### Live HF Space
The environment is deployed and responding at https://ride4code-study-planner-env.hf.space

### Agent Run
Below is a real agent run showing the structured `[START]` `[STEP]` `[END]` log format required by the OpenEnv spec. The smart agent prioritises subjects by urgency, coverage gap, and fatigue level.

## Why This Environment Exists

Study planning is one of the most universal human tasks, yet no existing OpenEnv environment models it. Unlike game-based benchmarks, this environment captures real cognitive constraints: knowledge decays without review, fatigue accumulates with repeated study, subject dependencies enforce learning order, and unexpected disruptions force dynamic replanning. An agent that performs well here has learned genuine scheduling intelligence — not just pattern matching. This fills a direct gap in the RL benchmark ecosystem.

An RL environment where AI agents allocate study hours across subjects to maximise exam coverage under time and budget constraints. Features fatigue modeling, retention decay, subject dependencies, mock exams, and exam surprises.

## Action Space
```json
{"subject": "Math", "hours": 2.0, "session_type": "new_material"}
```
- `subject`: one of the available subjects for the task
- `hours`: float between 0.0 and 12.0
- `session_type`: `new_material` | `review` | `practice` (practice requires 50% coverage first)

## Observation Space
```json
{
  "subjects": ["Math", "Physics", "Chemistry"],
  "hours_remaining": {"Math": 4.0, "Physics": 4.0, "Chemistry": 3.0},
  "days_until_exam": {"Math": 5, "Physics": 7, "Chemistry": 6},
  "total_hours_left": 16.0,
  "coverage_pct": {"Math": 0.6, "Physics": 0.4, "Chemistry": 0.3},
  "retention": {"Math": 0.6, "Physics": 0.4, "Chemistry": 0.3},
  "fatigue_level": {"Math": 0.5, "Physics": 0.0, "Chemistry": 0.0},
  "study_history": {"Math": [2.0, 2.0], "Physics": [], "Chemistry": []},
  "session_count": {"Math": 2, "Physics": 0, "Chemistry": 0},
  "dependency_unlocked": {"Math": true, "Physics": false, "Chemistry": true},
  "available_session_types": {"Math": ["new_material", "review", "practice"]},
  "mock_exam_result": null,
  "exam_schedule_changed": false,
  "message": "Allocated 2.0h to Math.",
  "done": false
}
```

## Tasks

| Task | Subjects | Budget | Required | Difficulty | Max Score |
|------|----------|--------|----------|------------|-----------|
| easy | 3 | 18h | 13h | No penalties, no decay | 1.00 |
| medium | 4 | 22h | 25h | Disruptions, 4% decay, mock exam | ~0.75 |
| hard | 5 | 26h | 35h | Dependencies, surprise, 7% decay | ~0.45 |
| extreme | 6 | 24h | 55h | All mechanics, 10% decay, 6 disruptions | ~0.25 |

## Baseline Scores

| Task | Random Agent | Smart Agent (Qwen2.5-72B) | Gap |
|------|-------------|--------------------------|-----|
| easy | 0.87 | 1.00 | +0.13 |
| medium | 0.21 | 0.54 | +0.33 |
| hard | 0.15 | 0.21 | +0.06 |
| extreme | ~0.05 | ~0.07 | +0.02 |

The gap on medium (+0.33) demonstrates the reward signal is meaningful — a smart agent significantly outperforms random allocation.

## Key Mechanics

- **Fatigue**: Repeated study of same subject reduces effective hours
- **Retention Decay**: Knowledge fades if subject not reviewed — agent must re-study
- **Dependencies**: Some subjects require prerequisite coverage first
- **Mock Exam**: Mid-episode exam reveals weak subjects and boosts their priority
- **Exam Surprise**: One subject exam moves 2 days earlier unexpectedly
- **Session Types**: new_material, review, practice — each with different fatigue/retention tradeoffs

## Reward Function

Each step reward is shaped by these components:

- **Urgency** — subjects with exams sooner receive higher weight
- **Coverage need** — subjects further from full coverage receive higher weight
- **Session bonus** — practice gives 1.3x, review 1.1x, new_material 1.0x
- **Fatigue penalty** — repeated study reduces effective hours and reward
- **Synergy bonus** — studying Math boosts Physics/CS, Chemistry boosts Biology
- **Penalty subjects** — over-studying History or Chemistry incurs a penalty

This produces a dense reward signal across all steps, not just at episode end.

## Architecture

The environment follows a simple client-server design:

**inference.py** (OpenAI client / agent) calls `reset()`, `step()`, and `grade()` over HTTP.

**FastAPI server** (`server/app.py`) handles requests and delegates to the environment core.

**Environment core** (`server/study_planner_env_environment.py`) manages all state:
- Fatigue system — reduces effective study hours on repeated sessions
- Retention decay — knowledge fades if a subject is not reviewed
- Dependency graph — Physics requires Math, Biology requires Chemistry
- Mock exam engine — mid-episode exam reshuffles subject priorities
- Synergy bonus — Math retention boosts Physics and CS rewards
- Grader — scores final coverage between 0.0 and 1.0
